New Project Completed — Role-Based Authentication System
I recently built a backend application using Spring Boot + Spring Security that implements secure role-based access control.

🔍 Highlights:
 ✔ Custom authentication using database
 ✔ Encrypted passwords with BCrypt
 ✔ Role-restricted APIs (ADMIN vs USER)
 ✔ Postman-tested REST endpoints
 ✔ Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repo)

🎯 Key takeaways:
Strengthened my understanding of secure application design
Learned best practices for handling credentials and roles
Improved debugging and configuration with Spring Security
I’m excited to continue improving my backend skills and open to feedback, collaboration, and opportunities!
